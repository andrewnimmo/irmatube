<h2>About IRMATube</h2>
<p>This demo is a fictious video-streaming
    service that demonstrates several aspects of IRMA. When you become
    IRMATube “member” you receive membership attributes. Subsequently, you
    can use these to watch (trailers of) movies on the IRMATube main page.</p>
<p>In particular, the IRMATube demo illustrates the following aspects of
    attribute-based authentication.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Upon becoming member of IRMATube you receive <em>two</em> attributes: one
        which simply proves that you are a member, and one which contains a
        personal membership number. When you wish to watch a movie, only
        your membership attribute is requested, not the membership number
        that identifies you: you only prove that you are a member, not who
        you are.</p>
    <p>In a more elaborate and realistic scenario you may want to reveal
        your membership number too in case you want a movie to be added to
        your profile. That is not included in the current version of the
        IRMATube demo.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Some of the movies on IRMATube have an age limit. When you wish to
        watch those movies, you have to reveal not only your IRMATube
        membership attribute, but also your age limit attribute. (These
        attributes can be obtained <a href="https://services.nijmegen.nl/irma/issue/start">here</a> or <a href="/issuance/idin">here</a>.)</p>
    </li>
</ul>
