Data directory
--------------

You are mostly responsible for filling this directory yourself. You need to add:

 * pk.pem - The public key of the API server you are using
 * sk.pem - The private key with which requests to the API server are signed
 * videos/ - A directory containing `*.webm`, `*.mp4`, `*.access` files for the movies you include

If you change the names of these files, or move the location of this folder relative to the www/ directory, be sure to update config.php.
